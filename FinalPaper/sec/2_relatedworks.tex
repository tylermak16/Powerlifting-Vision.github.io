As stated before, there have been many models developed for the purpose of 3D human pose estimation. Such models include PoseFormer, Detectron2, VideoPose3D, and PETR-Pose. [Remarks about their performance from their specific papers here]. For this problem, it is not of interest to reinvent 3D pose estimation models, but rather to apply them to a specific, niche problem. We are interested in how the output from these models can be used in determining squat depth in Powerlifting.
